## Overview

This project's main goal is to help our retail client use data for better decision-making. We'll build a strong data system that includes an Operational Data Store (ODS) and a Data Warehouse. This project includes the tasks of combining, refining, and organizing data, developing analytical models, and showcasing the outcomes in a user-friendly manner using data visualizations and dashboards.

## Software requirements:
- MS SQL server
- Windows OS

## Enterprise Data Warehouse was built in MSSQL Server using SSMS
- Led complete database lifecycle management including installation, upgrade, troubleshooting, migration, and security.
- Conducted stakeholder analysis and requirements gathering sessions, aligning data with business needs.
- Designed Conceptual and Logical data models for the OLTP Operational Data Store (ODS) and implemented Physical Data models using Bill Inmon’s Relational Modeling Techniques in the MSSQL Server using SSMS. 
- Created Bus Matrix (composition of Business process, Granularity, Facts, Fact Tables, and Dimensions).
- Designed and implemented Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) using Ralph Kimball’s Dimensional Modelling Approach.
- Created and configured Staging, EDW, and Control Framework databases on MS SQL Server.

## ETL Pipeline was built in Visual Studio using SSIS

- The project aimed to create an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for data extraction, transformation, and loading into SQL Server Databases from the flat-file (CSV) and OLDBE sources.
- Designed SQL Server Integration Service (SSIS) packages and wrote T-SQL scripts for extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from different data sources to ODS, ODS to a staging area and subsequently to the data warehouse.
- Created a metric table for an audit of Source Count, Pre-Count, Destination Count, and Post Count for ODS, Source Count, and Destination Count Staging database, and Pre, Current, Post, Type1, and Type2 Counts for EDW using the Control framework database.
- Implemented server agent for automated data loading and scheduling.

## Datamart was built using SSAS for Business Users

- Cubes were built using SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) for multi-dimensional and Tabular analysis for business users. These cubes supported interactive dashboards and data visualizations for informed decision-making.
